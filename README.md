# **Chromeos Facts and Glitches**
Btw, feel free to make a PR or a Issue if you find a bug
## #1: Get the normal (non-lacros) browser with #lacros-only enabled
1. Enable `chrome://flags/#lacros-selection-ignore`, `chrome://flags/#lacros-availability-ignore`, `chrome://flags/#lacros-stability`, and `chrome://flags/#lacros-only` flags, then click the restart button.
2. Enable `os://flags/#allow-devtools-in-system-ui` and restart again.
3. Open up settings.
4. Press `Control + U`.
5. Enjoy the browser you should'nt have :D

### Okay, cool. Why should I care about something like this?
- Its obviously not a intended feature, so using it is "rebellious" and "cool"
- You get to stick it to the team of developers who made chrome OS :P
- You get another browser.
